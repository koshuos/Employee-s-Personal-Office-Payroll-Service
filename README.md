Employee's Personal Office: Payroll Service

This service allows employees to access their personal payroll information. With the service, a company employee can securely receive their pay slip directly. The platform is a protected and secure web-based system, where access is granted through user-generated passwords for authorization. This ensures that all payroll-related data is kept confidential and is accessible only by the authorized user.
